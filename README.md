# CG Fragment Shaders
Fun with Fragment Shaders!
This project involves creating fun  visual effects by manipulating textures using fragment shaders in GLSL through Babylon's WebGL2 API. This web application will implement five filters—Black & White, Fish Eye, Ripple, Toonify and Swirl—each transforming textures in distinct ways, such as converting images to grayscale, applying barrel distortion for a fish-eye effect, creating ripple-like waves, producing a cartoon-style look, and creating a swirl like effect. 

To run this code you must have Node.js already installed. Clone the repository and open it in your desired IDE and run:
```
npm install
```
to install the required packages. Lastly run:
```
npm run dev
```
to start the server.
